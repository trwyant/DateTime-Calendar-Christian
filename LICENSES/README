When I adopted this distribution the lincenses were all in one file,
named LICENSE. This was divided into three parts. The first part was the
following statement:

    Terms of Perl itself
     
    a) the GNU General Public License as published by the Free
       Software Foundation; either version 1, or (at your option) any
       later version, or
    b) the "Artistic License"

The second and third parts were copies of the Gnu GPL version 2 (sic)
and the Artistic License. I have taken the liberty of repackaging this
in my usual way:

- A license statement in the COPYRIGHT section of the POD, which
  includes language I believe to be equivalent to the above, plus the
  Perl-Foundation-recommended disclaimer;

- A copy of the Gnu GPL version 1 as LICENSES/Copying;

- A copy of the Artistic license as LICENSES/Artistic.
